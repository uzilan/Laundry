About

This application will try to create a scalable application simulating a simple booking system, featuring:
* [Scala] as the programming language
* [sbt] as the build tool
* [Vaadin] as the UI framework
* [CQRS] as the separation concept
* [Event Sourcing] as itself
* [Cassandra] as the database
